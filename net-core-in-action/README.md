## [Chapter 18](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter18)

* *CustomHttpsCertificate* - A basic Razor Pages app using Kestrel with a self-signed certificate, similar to the way you would configure a certificate in production. Shows configuring the default certificate used by Kestrel in _appsettings.json_.

On Windows, you can generate a self-signed certificate using the *Install-Certificate.ps1* PowerShell script. This will create a self-signed certificate and add it to Windows' trusted certificate store.

You can generate a certificate on Ubuntu using *install_certificate.sh*. This uses *localhost.conf* to create a self signed certificate, and trusts it. On Linux, not all applications use the same store, so you may have to trust it explicitly for those applications. Use password `testpassword` to create the certificate.

* *CrossSiteScripting* - A simple app to demonstrate XSS attacks due to not encoding user input. The user submits content which is added to an internal list and is later rendered to the page. Using `@Html.Raw` renders the provided input exactly as it was entered - if the content is malicious, e.g. a `<script>` tag, then it is written into the page as a script tag, executing any code it contains. Instead, you should render content with the `@` symbol alone - that way the content is rendered as a string, and can be displayed safely.

* *CrossSiteRequestForgery* - A pair of apps to demonstrate a CSRF vulnerability. You can login to the banking application and view your balance. You can 'withdraw' funds using the provided form, and you'll see your balance reduce. The attacker website contains a form that posts to the banking application and withdraws funds for the currently logged in user. In the example you have to click the button to see the vulnerability, but this could easily be automated. To protect the endpoint, add the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute to the `BalanceController.Withdraw()` action. Run both applications by selecting "Set Startup Projects" in Visual Studio, or by running both applications using `dotnet run`.

* *CorsApplication* - A pair of apps to demonstrate CORS. The "shopping.com" site is a Razor Pages application, that loads a product list from a separate app, "api.shopping.com", hosted at a different host. With the default configuration, the request succeeds. Experiment by removing the default CORS policy from the `UseCors()` middleware configuration, and applying `[EnableCors]` to the `ProductsController` instead. Note that it's the _API_ that defines which applications can call it. Run both applications by selecting "Set Startup Projects" in Visual Studio, or by running both applications using `dotnet run`.

## [Chapter 19](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter19)

* *CustomMiddleware* - Various custom middleware, using, `Map`, `Run`, `Use`, and middleware classes, as described in section 19.1. See _Startup.cs_ for a description of how each middleware responds to requests.
* *CustomEndpoint* - The `PingPongMiddleware`, `VersionMiddleware`, and `CalculatorMiddleware`, from the *CustomMiddleware* project, exposed as endpoints using _endpoint routing_, as described in section 19.2. The `CalculatorMiddleware` demonstrates how routing can be used to extract route parameters. The Health Checks endpoint (built-into ASP.NET Core), has authorization applied with `RequireAuthorization`, so you must be logged in to access it. This project is a basic RazorPages application with Identity using Sqlite to make it easier to authenticate and test authorization.
* *CustomConfiguration* - Loading configuration in multiple stages, as described in section 19.3.1. The _baseconfig.xml_ file is loaded first, and is used to locate the _appsettings.json_ file, which is added to the configuration.
* *ConfigureOptionsExample* - Configuring `IOptions` using services as described in section 19.3.2. The `CurrencyOptions` in configured in multiple ways - from configuration values, from static values (using a Lambda), and using `ConfigureCurrencyOptions` which uses a service registered in the DI container.
* *LamarExample* - Replacing the default DI container with Lamar (the successor to StructureMap), as in section 19.4. Demonstrates some of the functionality available in Lamar.

## [Chapter 20](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter20)

* *CustomTagHelpers* - Creating custom Tag Helpers, an `IfTagHelper` and `SystemInfoTagHelper`, as shown in section 20.1.
* *RecipeApplication* - The Recipe Application from previous chapters, this time with a custom view component, as described in section 20.2.
* *CurrencyConverter* - The demo Currency converter application, containing a custom validation attribute for validating the selected currencies, as in section 20.3.
* *FluentValidationConverter* - The demo Currency converter application, configured to use the FluentValidation library instead of DataAnnotations. Contains validation extension methods for validating the selected currencies, as in section 20.4.

## [Chapter 21](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter21)

* *SocketExhaustion* - A simple application that creates many `HttpClient`s, demonstrating sockets being consumed. Run `netstat` in a separate window, to view sockets stuck in the `TIME_WAIT` status, as discussed in section 21.1.1.
* *ExchangeRateViewer* - An API controller that calls a remote exchange rate API, and returns the value. Shows 4 different ways of using `HttpClient` and `IHttpClientFactory`:
  * Singleton `HttpClient`: A single `HttpClient` that lives for the life of the application, as discussed in section 21.1. This client won't respect DNS changes.
  * Using `IHttpClientFactory` to create an `HttpClient`, as described in section 21.2.1.
  * Using a _named_ `HttpClient`, as described in section 21.2.2
  * Creating a _typed_ `HttpClient`, as described in section 21.2.3
  * Adding transient error handling using _Polly_ in `Startup.ConfigureServices()`, as described in section 21.3

## [Chapter 22](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter22)

* *BackgroundServiceCache* - An `IHostedService` that downloads exchange rates from a remote API and saves them in a dictionary, for consumption by an API controller, as described in section 22.1.1
* *BackgroundServiceDatabaseCache* - An `IHostedService` that uses scoped services, downloads exchange rates from a remote API and saves them in a dictionary, as described in section 22.1.2
* *SystemdService* - A generic `Host` to download exchange rates, configured to executes as a systemd daemon, as described in section 22.2
* *WindowsService* - A generic `Host` to download exchange rates, configured to executes as a Windows Service, as described in section 22.2.
* *QuartzHostedService* - A generic `Host` that uses Quartz.NET to run background tasks
* *QuartzClustering* - A generic `Host` that uses Quartz.NET to run background tasks configured to use clustering. Note that SQLite is not supported for clustering, so this application uses LocalDB

## [Chapter 23](https://github.com/andrewlock/asp-dot-net-core-in-action-2e/tree/master/Chapter23)

* *ExchangeRates* - A basic exchange rate application. Includes unit tests for the `CurrencyConverter` class (section 23.2), for the `StatusMiddleware` (section 23.3), and for API controllers (section 23.4). It also includes "Test Host" integration tests for the `StatusMiddleware` (section 23.5.1) as well as `WebApplicationFactory`-based integration tests for the whole app (section 23.5.2, 23.5.3, 23.5.4).
* *RecipeApplication* - Testing a service that relies on an EF Core `DbContext`, as described in section 23.6. The `RecipeServiceTests` class shows how you can test the `RecipeService` using the in-memory SQLite provider. Also shows a custom `WebApplicationFactory` implementation that uses an in-memory database.
